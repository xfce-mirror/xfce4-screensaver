# xfce4-screensaver

Xfce4-screensaver is a screen saver and locker that aims to have
simple, sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with the desktop.

This project is a port of [MATE Screensaver](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-screensaver),
itself a port of [GNOME Screensaver](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/gnome-screensaver).
It has been tightly integrated with the Xfce desktop, utilizing Xfce
libraries and the Xfconf configuration backend.

 - Locking down of configuration settings via Xfconf

 - Idle time and inhibition state are based on the X11 Screensaver extension

 - No GNOME or MATE dependencies. Requirements are lightweight and shared with Xfce.
